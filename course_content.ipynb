    "\n",
    "[**Forking**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks): Creating a copy of someones repository, that you want to work with. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. For example, you will create an online copy of another repository under your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Cloning**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-remote): Meaning to create a local copy of an online repository (called \"remote\"s on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Branching**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches): Meaning to create a copy of a project either online or locally, so that you have an isolated copy where you can work without affecting other branches in a repository. Each repository has one default branch, usually called the \"main\" branch, and can have multiple other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Committing**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-commit): A commit is a \"snapshot\" of your repository at one specific point in time. If you change a repository, you will have to follow up with \"committing\" the changes to save file changes to your Git repository. This does not mean that your changes will be lost if you, e.g., shut down your system; it just means that the version between a file on your system and the logged version in the GitHub repository does not match.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pulling**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-pull): Means simply to update you local repository with the corresponidng online (remote) repository. For, if you or someone else made changes to the online version of a repository, you pull or \"download\" these changes to your local files this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pushing**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/git-push-to-remote-branch): Git push is used to upload a local repositoryâ€™s content to a remote repository. Meaning that you send your locally committed changes to your online repository.\n",
